                <h2>History</h2>
                <p class="contact">Back in the 1950's Chester Derbyshire owned much of the land in this area. He platted and sub-divided it in the mid-1950s. 
                    Chester was to pave roads, install hydrants, water system, and drains. (Some of you will note that we do not actually have hydrants on the system). </p>
                <p> Many of the lots were to be developed by Ray Perrin. Once development was completed, the intent was to hand over the well system, and an alternate well plot to the owners of the land, and the system was in operation in 1959, 
                    and the first meeting for the water district was 1960, fully incorporated and turned over to the land owners. Since incorporation, there were two court cases that involved our 
                    little water district that went all the way to the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/1964/36757-1.html">State Supreme Court.</a>One of those cases, a water rights case, has been cited by 6 other times in additional water rights cases.
                </p>
                <p> While homes were being built on the land, there was a dispute between Chester and Ray about the viability of some of the lots, and they went to court. While the court cases continued on in the early to mid 1960's,
                    Chester passed away in August of 1962, and Ray in February of 1965. Ultimately the cases were settled on behalf of their estates. </p> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/1966/38431-1.html">Here's the final outcome.</a>
